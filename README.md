the above files where added to this repository using remote git repository from my local repository (using: "git remote add origin <url of github repository>", then "git branch -M branch", then "git push -u origin main", from my main local repository)
so this is just a test, the files doesnt contain anything, i just wanted to see if i still remember my git command lines etc.

the reason for my network graph is because, i committed, then i had to pull from the remote repository, in order to push to the remote repository, thats why the last 'green' branch is connected before the 'blue' branch
